		This project aims to provide users with a means to access news stories from sources on both sides of the political spectrum.  In doing so, it hopes to pop the <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28556/filter-bubble"> filter bubbles</a> we exist in, “a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see”. It is designed to make users more aware of the way in which facts are presented and potentially influenced by the author’s political views by offering a side-by-side comparison of how any topic of the user’s choosing is presented in liberal and conservative news sources (the former colored in blue and the latter, red), and from there make a more informed decision on what he or she chooses to believe. Drawing inspiration from the Wall Street Journal’s <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/">Blue Feed, Red Feed</a>, which aims to dispel the echo chambers social networking sites create through interactions with like-minded people that tend to reinforce our existing worldviews, this site hopes to provide a platform to explore views different from one’s own. <br><br>

The comparative news feed site draws from the New York Times API and News API (with the news source parameter filtered to only include Fox News). The creator of this site had particular difficulty with splitting the webpage in halves to show both news headlines, which she thinks is an apt metaphor for one’s difficulty in splitting one’s worldview. This <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRmQN244Ir0"> youtube link </a> helped. <br><br>

This site hopes to expand by offering more news sources on either side of the spectrum.
